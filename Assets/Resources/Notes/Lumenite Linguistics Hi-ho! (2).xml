Rather than the typical ‘hi-ho’ of their warmer counterparts, they have instead learnt to greet others with ‘ho-hi’. In the Frostbaned depths, it was previously standard practice to maintain a rigid call and response between the leader and other miners in order to keep communication going. The mine leader would call out with ‘Hi-ho’, to which the miners would respond ‘Ho-hi’. The Frostbaned Lumenites, many of whom worked alongside the miners, picked up on the ‘ho-hi’ and similarly to their warmer counterparts began to incorporate it into their speech.&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/align&gt;&lt;/size&gt;&lt;br&gt;</messageText>
