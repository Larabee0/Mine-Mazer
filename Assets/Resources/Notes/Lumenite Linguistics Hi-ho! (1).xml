In the previous century, hi-ho (prev. heigh-ho) was used by many miners as an exclamation of boredom, and often chanted in the mines throughout working hours to keep a steady, rhythmic workflow. The Lumenites adopted this exclamation as a part of their own language, taking its meaning to be a greeting, and a show of equal respect between themselves and the miners. It has since bled into their vernacular as a prefix and occasional infix, as well as a general exclamation, often of surprise or joy. They will greet all they deem welcome within the mines with ‘hi-ho’, according to Lumenite Linguistics expert Dr Calcflinta, and have yet to be observed in how they greet unwelcome visitors.&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/align&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/size&gt;&lt;br&gt;</messageText>
