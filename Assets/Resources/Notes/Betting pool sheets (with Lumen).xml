Some of the betting pools are for money, while others offer resources or even an extra break or two. Recent bets include: ‘How many rocks can Arkose fit inside his mouth (it was four)’, ‘Will Blair get caught if she takes a dip in the mine water (she did, and was promptly written up over it)’ and ‘When will Drs Hornfels and Siltstone get over themselves and start dating (jury’s still out)’. ]&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/align&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/size&gt;&lt;br&gt;</messageText>
