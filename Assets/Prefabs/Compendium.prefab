  - title: Anti-Lumen
    category: Mine Features
    summary: "A dark crystal that sucks in light and warps magical energy. On its
      own it can\u2019t do much, but combining it with other crystals can lead to
      powerful effects"
    body: 'Anti-Lumen is the natural antithesis to Lumen, and tends to form in areas
      nearer the outskirts of the mines. While research has been conducted into its
      nature, much of it is unsubstantial and inconclusive. While Anti-Lumen is used
      in some mine technology, it is generally advised that miners avoid Anti-Lumen
      where possible, as prolonged exposure has been known to have long-term effects
      on both human and Lumenite health. Anti-Lumen has a similar hardness to Lumen,
      but an inverted molecular structure. '

  - title: Lumen
    category: Mine Features
    summary: 'A pale, glowing crystal species that absorbs magic and can store an
      amount equivalent to its size. The light of these crystals is believed to reveal
      hidden secrets.  '
    body: "Lumen is, according to documents recovered from the first miners, a \u2018condensed
      essence of light and creation itself\u2019. From research conducted into the
      nature of Lumen, it has been revealed to be a form of condensed energy that
      is able to coalesce and gather in a crystalline formation. The crystal has
      a Mohs hardness of approximately 8.5, however certain areas have been tested
      up to a Mohs hardness of 10. There is much we do not know about Lumen still,
      as it is a protected resource native to the mines, however its primary use
      in modern times is as an energy source, with secondary uses in hidden communication
      due to its fluorescent properties, and as a natural light source. "

  - title: Antarcticite
    category: Rocks, minerals and crystals
    summary: A rare crystal only found in the coldest parts of the mines, said to
      freeze anyone who touches it directly. Its uses are limited, but very powerful.
    body: "Antarcticite is a rare deliquescent mineral that runs in the mine\u2019s
      veins throughout sections affected by Frostbane- a supernatural affliction
      caused by mineral deficiencies in cold, dry areas. It is typically found in
      its crystallised form, however at sufficient temperatures it is able to become
      an aqueous solution. It is extremely fragile, at a Mohs hardness of only 2.5.
      Antarcticite has a variety of uses, but must be handled carefully due to risk
      of becoming Frostbaned. Current uses include but are not limited to: food preservation,
      cooking, luxury skincare, medical uses, sanitation, mixology and technological
      use (when combined with Anti-Lumen). "
