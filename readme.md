## Description
Let the mines, and your spirits, never waver from the light we all share. Or else power shall destroy us, and the mines shall take back what is owed...

Lumenseeker is a first-person exploration game taking place in an ever-changing mine, built through procedural generation and decoration systems, where no playthrough is exactly the same. As a new miner now trapped in the mines with no known way out, it’s up to you to figure out what’s gone wrong and how to fix it. Explore your surroundings, collaborate and trade with the Lumenites- crystalline entities born from the mines, to discover the secrets of what lies beneath the surface.

## Verbose Description
### Visible Technology
This game takes place in a procedurally generated cave system made up of a set of sections that can be assembled together.
The game has a procedurally generated minimap that show elevation and where you have been and areas of interest.
Steamdeck support
### Navigation
As you walk through the mine sections behind you are remove after a certain distance, if you go back they will be different.
Some sections get saved in place, for example the Lumenite village area. The game counts the number of sections travelled from the fixed place.
So long as the player travels back the same number of sections, it will respawn the location and keep it spawned unless it goes out of range again. 
### Invisible Technology
Procedural decoration tool that the developers used to generate 100s of points within each section which is saved with the section.
This is used to unqiuely decorate the inside of the cave whenever the section is spawned to help it feel less like the same few sections put together.
